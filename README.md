# pacea-data
A data repository for very large data sets that get used by the pacea package

This repository stores very large data (or model outputs) that get imported by our pacea R package https://github.com/pbs-assess/pacea. Small data sets (such as simple time series) are part of pacea itself. Descriptions of all data sets will be part of pacea, and pacea will contain functions to extract data automatically from pacea-data. The pacea user does not need to use or clone pacea-data, everything will be done through pacea.
